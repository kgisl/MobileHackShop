And Nandhakumar (he uses Ionic extensively), and so do Sivaraj and KGH team. They can come up with a cheatsheet like the one for React Native (above). SO both environments can be given, and a sample app can be developed in both environments.


**AGENDA**:

First half -  **React**  Native

Second half -  **Ionic**  -> and support for Progressive Web Apps (PWA).
